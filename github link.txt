Project Overview

To create a weather API app and handle 2 API calls. By default, the user lands on the landing screen which just shows the fetch data button.
On clicking the fetch data button, first the geolocation API returns the lat and long and displays a google map of the current location. Then the weather data section shows, where all the details provided in the API response are handled.
Use the geolocation API to get your current laptop's lat and long.
